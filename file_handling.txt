Python is one of the most commonly used programming languages by data scientists and machine learning engineers. Although there has been no universal study on the prevalence of Python machine learning algorithms, a 2019 GitHub analysis of public repositories tagged as "machine-learning" not surprisingly found that Python was the common language used. Python outranked other languages commonly used in the data science community including R, Scala, and Julia. This is all to say that if you're interested in being a data scientist or a machine learning engineer, then understanding Python should be on your to-do list. It's important to remmber though that employing machine learning techniques involves more than just coding for coding's sake. an important part of the job of a data scientist or machine learning engineer is using programming languages to apply statistical methods and develop machine learning algorithms.
